Hi there!

I am a PhD Candidate in **evolutionary biology** at the University of Groningen, NL.\
In my research I use (single-cell) gene expression and chromatin accessibilty data from threespined stickleback fish (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) to address questions about gene regualtory evolution and the role of (gene expression) plasticity in adaptation. <///><

Since my PhD chapters are not yet published, most of my repos remain private for the time being. \
If you are interested in my projects, feel free to reach out! \
If you are just looking to see if I can program at all, you can find some examples [here](https://github.com/jhagauer/forexample)
